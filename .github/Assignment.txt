Questions:

1. What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming? Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Software engineering is an art of science that deals with the design, development, testing and maintainance of software applications.
Software engineering differs from traditional programming when it comes to reduced cost, customer satisfaction, improved quality, increased productivity, better maintainanblitiy and scalability.

2. Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase. 
Phases of SDLC include:
	a. Planning
	b. Requirement analysis
	c. Design
	d. Coding
	e. Testing
	f. Deployment
	e. Maintainace
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
	Agile Model - This and iterative and incremental approach with emphasise to flexibility and collaboration
	Waterfall Model - Each phase must be completed prior to moving onto the next phase. This is a linear and sequential approach.

3. Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred? Requirements Engineering:
The key difference between Waterfall model and Agile model is that waterfall is a traditional model that is linear unlike Agile model which is more iterative and flexible.
Waterfall has a fixed timeline thus not having the stakeholder involved along the way unlike Agile model, due to its flexibility it is easy to involve stakeholders.

4. What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle. 
This is the process of estabilishing requirements needed and also documenting the requirments.
The process involves identifying, eliciting, analyzing, specifying, validating, and managing the needs and expectations of the client for the software system to be created.
Software Design Principles:
	a. Problem partitioning
	b. Abstraction
	c. Modularity
	d.Top down & Bottom Up strategy 

5. Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems? Testing in Software Engineering:
Modularity is the concept of dividing a software into modules which are then worked on differently but are later merged together to bring back a complete functional software.
Mintainability and scalability is improved sice it provides a framework that is more accessible to testing and allows the creation of lareg programs that can be accesesed by differet people.

6. Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). 
	a. unit testing - This invloves the testing of individual units by develpers to makes sure each unit is working as inteneded.
	b. integration testing - This invloves the testing of how different units work together thus helping in identification of issues and resolving them.
	c. system testing - This test involves the whole system to check on its performance and functionality.
	d. acceptance testing - This inlvoles assertaining that the the developed product performs the desired task and it is done they the client
Why is testing crucial in software development? Version Control Systems:
Testing is cruical in that a system should be error free and it is conducted to be able to identify errors and resolving them before it is handed back to the client.

7. What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features. Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects? Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle? Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
